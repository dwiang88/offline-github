The only exception was needed for `filters` as JavaScript does not support filters, in this case, a filter is transformed into a `CallExpression` that has an extra property named `filter` with the value of `true`. This phase is heavily based on the previous implementation of `$parse`.\r\n\r\nThe AST processing phase transforms the AST into a function that can be executed to evaluate the expression. The logic for expressions remains unchanged. The AST processing phase works in two different ways depending if csp is enabled or disabled. If csp is enabled, the processing phase returns pre-generated function that interpret specific parts of the AST.\r\nWhen csp is disabled, then the entire expression is compiled into a single function that is later evaluated using `Function`. In both cases, the returning function has the properties `constant`, `literal` and `inputs` as in the previous implementation. These are used in the next phase to perform different optimizations.\r\n\r\nThe cacheing, one-time binding and `$watch` optimizations phase remains mostly unchanged.\r\n\r\n[1] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey/Parser_API"

However there is crucial feature of many popular logging APIs that it is missing: log levels.\r\n\r\nAfter the application is stable enough, I would like to disable most of the log messages without actually going into the code and physically remove them.\r\n\r\nAngular itself has a `debugEnabled()` which comes quite handy: https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/provider/$logProvider\r\n\r\nHowever, at the moment there is no way to say:\r\n\r\n* Show me only the error messages (omit warnings, info and log messages)\r\n* Show me only warnings and errors\r\n\r\nA typical log library allows you to specify what **level** of log you are interested to and only shows the log messages that have the requested level of seriousness that are prioritized like this:\r\n\r\n1. Error\r\n2. Warning\r\n3. Info\r\n4. Debug\r\n\r\nIt is understandable that since `$log` is merely a wrapper on top of `console`, it tries to stick to the API of the `console` but adding a function shouldn't ruin the whole idea. `console` itself has various \"extra\" function from browser to browser. Clearly it is possible to write a service that does that but I was curious to know if having it built-in to angular will empower it even more."

          "body": "This is an initial suggestion for dealing with the current issues with angular cookies. The main things added by this:\r\n 1. An `options` parameter was added to `$cookieStore.put()` which supports passing `path`, `domain`, `expires` and `secure` parameters.\r\n 2. `$cookieStore` was refactored so it will use `$browser.cookies()` directly instead of going through `$cookies`. This was in order to allow direct update/read of cookies instead of going through polling/digest mechanism.\r\n 2. `$cookies` was deprecated in order to stop using the polling/digest mechanism and instead `getRaw`, `getAll` and `putRaw` methods were added to `$cookieStore` in order to accommodate some of the stuff that were previously available only when using `$cookies`\r\n\r\nThis is obviously just my take on this and completely open for discussion.\r\n\r\nSome open issues:\r\n 1. The cookie setting logic is currently located in `$browser` although it is not used internally by angular (angular only uses the cookie reading logic for `XSRF-TOKEN`). It might be better to just move it into `ngCookies`. On the other hand maybe it should be left in `$browser` for balance, I don't know.\r\n 2. Theoretically it is possible to leave `$cookies` alive and make its properties getters/setters using `Object.defineProperty` (assuming everyone else agrees that polling/digest mechanism is bad), but we would still need some sort of polling for learning about new cookies. I think we'd better just deprecate it.\r\n 3. I'm somewhat uncomfortable with the `getRaw`/`get` and `putRaw`/`put` duplication. Another option can be to use something like `isJsonLike` in `$http` or add a flag to `get`/`put` or use `try`/`catch` or maybe even configure this behavior in a `$cookieStoreProvider`, but I don't like it very much. Since `getRaw`/`putRaw` are consistent with `getAll` (which must be raw imo), I like this option best.\r\n 4. Might be good to add a `$cookieStoreProvider` in order to give better defaults for options, I dunno."
